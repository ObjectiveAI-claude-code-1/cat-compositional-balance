Task 1 — Evaluate Intentionality of Placement: Look at where the cat is positioned within the rectangle of the photograph and determine whether that position feels deliberately chosen or accidental. A cat whose placement communicates purpose — whether centered with quiet symmetry, offset along a compositional line, or partially hidden in a way that serves a visual narrative — should score highly. A cat that appears to be drifting out of frame, awkwardly cropped for no discernible reason, or placed as though the camera was simply pointed in its general direction should score poorly. The evaluation is not about whether the cat is in any particular "correct" position, but about whether the position it occupies feels considered and intentional, as though someone or something decided that this was the spot.

Task 2 — Evaluate Spatial Dialogue: Examine the relationship between the cat and the negative space surrounding it within the frame, and determine whether the two are in visual conversation with each other. When spatial dialogue is strong, the empty areas of the photograph feel purposeful — they give the cat room to breathe, provide context and atmosphere, and balance against the cat's visual weight like two sides of a seesaw in equilibrium. When spatial dialogue breaks down, the space around the cat feels either suffocating — with the cat crammed against edges with no breathing room — or aimless, with the cat adrift in an expanse that serves no compositional purpose. The evaluation should measure whether the cat and the space around it are actively working together or merely coexisting without connection.

Task 3 — Evaluate Compositional Wholeness: Assess whether the cat's placement and its relationship to the surrounding space combine to produce a feeling of completeness — the sense that the photograph is finished, that the frame was built around this subject in this position, and that shifting the cat or cropping the image differently would diminish something essential. A photograph with strong compositional wholeness does not invite the viewer to re-compose it; it produces a quiet sense of resolution where nothing is missing and nothing is extraneous. A photograph lacking this quality feels as though its composition is still searching for an arrangement that works. This evaluation captures the emergent feeling that arises when intentionality and spatial dialogue work together to make the cat's position feel not just acceptable, but inevitable.
