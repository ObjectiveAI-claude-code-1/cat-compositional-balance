Evaluate the placement and balance of the cat within the frame. Determine where the cat is positioned relative to the boundaries of the photograph and assess whether that position feels purposeful and visually balanced. A cat placed with care — whether centered with quiet symmetry or offset with dynamic tension — should create the impression that it belongs exactly where it is. Consider whether the visual weight of the cat and the visual weight of the surrounding space are in dialogue, producing a sense of compositional wholeness. Reject placements that feel accidental: a cat awkwardly cropped at an edge, crammed into a corner without justification, or marooned in an undifferentiated expanse of empty space. The goal is to determine whether the cat's position within the rectangle of the image feels chosen — as though this placement, among all possible placements, is the one that makes the photograph feel complete. Score high when the cat's placement radiates intentionality and the frame feels built around it. Score low when the cat's position feels arbitrary, careless, or like the subject could have been anywhere without the composition changing.
